# Moon - SwiftUI
I created a simplified version of [Moon](https://github.com/LudoRWA/Moon) (my OpenSea portfolio app) using SwiftUI ðŸ¥³.   

I liked creating the UI using SwiftUI. Even if this technology is not mature, it already has great potential.  
I then articulate everything thanks to ViewModels and Models (MVVM design pattern) and voilÃ !
